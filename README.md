# sentiment-data-shiny

The app.R file compiles to create a Shiny app in R that visualises sentiment data. This sentiment data was collected in the first week of semester 2, 2023 through a Google Form by the STATS 399 course instructors at the University of Auckland. The sentiment data includes three columns of data:
- approximately 4 feelings felt by students prior to the course
- how students thought their peers felt about the course
- how students thought their instructors felt about the course
